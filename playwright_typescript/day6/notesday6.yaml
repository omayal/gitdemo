Open PowerShell as Administrator: Right-click on the PowerShell icon and choose "Run as Administrator" to ensure that you have the necessary permissions to change the execution policy.

Change Execution Policy: If the policy is set to "Restricted" or a more restrictive setting, you can change it. For example, to set the execution policy to "RemoteSigned" for the current user, run: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

Confirm Change: You may be prompted to confirm the change. Type 'Y' and press Enter.

Retry the Command: After changing the execution policy, try running your tsc --version command again.
